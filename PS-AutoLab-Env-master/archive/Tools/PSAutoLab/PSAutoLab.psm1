Note:
This module should not be considered to follow best practices. This is a collection of 'Control' scripts,
that use helping information that does not follow Advanced Function best practices.
This is intentional for the benefit and ease of use for students less familiar with PowerShell.
The goal was to make maintainence of the control scripts easier.

Note: These demos should not be run as a script. These are the commands that I use in the
demonstrations and would need to be modified for your environment.

    This module will set trusted hosts to connect to ANY remote machine. This is NOT a recommended
