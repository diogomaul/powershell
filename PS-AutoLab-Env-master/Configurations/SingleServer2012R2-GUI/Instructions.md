```powershell
PS> Setup-Lab

## To Patch a lab

If you want to make sure the virtual machines have the latest updates from Microsoft, you can run this command:

```powershell

```powershell
PS> Update-Lab -asjob
```

```powershell
PS> Wipe-Lab

You will be prompted for each virtual machine. Or you can force the removal and suppress the prompts:
